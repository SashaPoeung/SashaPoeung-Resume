        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology- Admin Studies</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second-year undergraduate student who is looking to graduate in four years with a Sociology bachelor’s degree with a focus in admin studies. I am currently a part-time barista who works over thirty hours a week and a part- babysitter. I am a part of an organization called Pi Beta Phi. This organization is the first female fraternity to ever exist and allows members to network within the Greek Community as well as the University of California Riverside. I have a strong background in communications and cooperative skills through my extracurricular activities in multiple clubs and outside organizations. Some organizations I have worked with consist of KIwanis International, Adopt and Shop, University of California: Los Angeles LA BioMed, and the Aquarium of the Pacific. Some positions I held within these organizations include Research Assistant, intern, president, treasurer, and volunteer. My main goal as an undergraduate student is to gain my sociology degree at the University of California Riverside and either go straight to graduates school or enter the workforce. I intend to become a social worker that focuses on the foster care system or forensic science. The dream school I had in mind is the University of Southern California, but a safety school of mine is the California State University of Long Beach.<br><br>

         During the Summer of my 3rd year of college, I want to be able to intern with the Los Angeles Police Department where I would help out with the administration department. As I am an independent individual who supports herself financially, I need to work part time. I am currently only enrolled in twelve units at the University of California Riverside and a majority of my courses are lower division courses. I had to start over as I switched to a different college focus. I went from the college of natural and agricultural sciences to the college of humanities and social sciences. The breadth courses were different, so I basically have to add into my workload if I plan to graduate within four years. I use to be a Biology major until I realized it was not the major for me. After taking organic chemistry, I was struggling greatly. I was not able to keep up with the course load, especially during the covid  nineteen pandemic. The pandemic has affected my work ethic as I had to pick up another job to help support my family.  My parents were in and out of work as their businesses reopened and shutdown rude to outbreaks.<br><br>

        Every other week I had to drive back and forth from riverside and Long Beach in order to take care of my grandparents by running errands for them, such as grocery shopping and doctor appointments. I am currently leasing a room in a house in riverside and rent is on the higher range, so I live paycheck to paycheck until everything starts to subside in regards to the pandemic. Once everything starts to get back to normal, I’ll be able to pick up more hours and hopefully be able to take things off of my plate.
